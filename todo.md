	- magic turn-notebook-cell-into-job-thing
 
	- notebook interaction vs early exploding (mostly testing)
	- 
	- robust history storing when the graph dies / is aborted during it's run?
	   - I suppose we could handle this with a log that we reapply later on?
	
	- jobs overwriting the files of other jobs (without declaring so!)
	  a hard problem, with little payoff?
	 
	- command runner job? Kind of a replacement for mbf_externals.ExternalAlgorithm
	 
	- write test case with our regular object structure
	 
	-ppg1 compatibility layer
	
	- tests for the interactive (console) parts.

	- a solution for the quadratic parts in modify_dag
